Evolving PCB designs for the AQ Sensor

## Firebeetle

This supercedes all previous PCB designs.

This design supports low power consumption hence, possible battery or solar operation. Aspects of the design are optional so, if you don't want to use Lora you can leave off the RFM95 module. Similarly, if you don't need an OLED you can leave off that part too (and thye switches). So, it's a flexible design.
