## Heltec Sensor V2

This is the second sensor designed with a purpose built PCB. Prior to this wires were soldered to the Heltec V2 pins.

## Heltec Sensor V3

To be added. 

This is the third generation sensor design with a purpose built PCB. The PCB includes components to enable the Heltec firmware to turn off the 3V3 supply to the GPS device and the 5V supply to the SDS011 particle sensor to reduce power consumption between readings which are taken 6 times per hour (10 readings for an hourly average)
