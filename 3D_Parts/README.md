The STL files herein work with the chosen box from ebay :- https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/IP65-Waterproof-Weatherproof-Junction-Box-Plastic-Enclosure-Case-UK/283521326596?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=584680955588&_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649

The side vent cowls are simply 21.5mm 90 degree waste overflow pipes from www.diy.com - also available from numerous internet suppliers.

We use 3x22mm shower filters (obtained from Ebay) to allow air in through the waste overflow pipes.

The cable entry glands were obtained from Amazon :- https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07QM6JMTV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

The kit requires 2xInner Vent Plugs and 2xouter vent plugs otherwise one of each is required.

Use PVC weld to seal the plugs thus making the case water tight.

The inner vent plugs protrude through the case so you can glue the side vent cowls to them.
